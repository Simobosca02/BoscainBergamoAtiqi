## 1. Project Description
Best Bike Paths (BBP) is a system that allows users to record, share, and explore bicycle routes.  
It aims to:
- Support bikers in logging their trips and viewing related statistics.  
- Enable users to insert or automatically collect information about bike path conditions.  
- Merge and visualize data to recommend optimal and safe bike routes based on community feedback.

## 2. Project Scope
Our group focuses on the complete functionality of BBP, including:
- The recording of personal trips
- The insertion of publishable information in manual mode
- The visualization of the information about possible paths between an origin and a 
destination specified by the user
- The insertion of publishable information in automated mode and its confirmation by the 
user
- The merging of information incoming from different users

## 3. Tools and Technologies
- **Modeling:** To be defined
- **Formal verification:** Alloy Analyzer  
- **Documentation:** To be defined  
- **Version control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Collaboration tools:** To be defined
